# A brief description of what your plugin is doing.
summary: |-
  This plugin for Traefik allows it to authenticate requests against Keycloak. It utilizes Keycloak’s client credentials flow to retrieve an access token, which is then set as a bearer token in the Authorization cookie and as a plain token in a custom-named cookie of the incoming requests. Optionally, it can also set the bearer token in the Authorization header. The plugin communicates with Keycloak using the OpenID Connect protocol.
  Additionally, it provides the ability to define a condition based on a regular expression applied to a claim.
  If the condition is not met, the request is denied with a 403 status code and the message "insufficient permissions", instead of granting access to the website.
